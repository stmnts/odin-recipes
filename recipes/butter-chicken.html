    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Okay, curry can be expensive both at a restaurant and when homemade. In order to make this happen, we have to simplify the recipe, maximize the flavor and make this dish for the very cheapest price physically possible...without losing flavor at all.</p>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, garam masala, and salt.</li>
        <li>Toss with sliced chicken thighs until fully coated. Cover and marinate for 30 minutes or overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering hot.</li>
        <li>Add chicken in batches and sear 2-3 minutes on each side. Set to side once done.</li>
        <li>Lower the same pan to medium heat, add a touch of more oil along with diced onions, diced ginger, sliced garlic, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix and stir, sauteing for 2-3 minutes or until softened.</li>
        <li>Add in spices (turmeric powder optional) and stir together until spices have toasted for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>After toasting, add in crushed tomatoes and water then stir until incorporated over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Let simmer for 5-8 minutes until the sauce has reduced.</li>
        <li>Once reduced, add chicken back to the pan mixing into the sauce and let simmer for 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in heavy cream stirring until thickened and incorporated. Bring up to a light simmer before reducing heat to low and simmering for no longer than 3-4 minutes. Stir often.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and continuously stir in unsalted butter until melted. Season to taste with salt.</li>
